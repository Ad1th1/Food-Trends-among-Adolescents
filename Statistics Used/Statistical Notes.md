These notes are just a list of the topics I learnt in class 11 and 12 under the subject of statistics.
The pdf of the textbook(Karnataka Board Class 11 and 12 Textbook) is provided in parts here: https://www.selfstudys.com/books/karnataka/state-books/class-11th/statistics

Notes:
> - representative units of a population is called a sample
> - numerically measurable characteristics are called quantitative characteristics

> - geometric mean = average change of growth
> - harmonic mean = averaging different rates producing equal effect
