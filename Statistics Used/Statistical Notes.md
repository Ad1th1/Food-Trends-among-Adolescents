These notes are just a list of the topics I learnt in class 11 and 12 under the subject of statistics.
The pdf of the textbook(Karnataka Board Class 11 and 12 Textbook) is provided in parts here: https://www.selfstudys.com/books/karnataka/state-books/class-11th/statistics

Notes:
> - representative units of a population is called a sample
> - numerically measurable characteristics are called quantitative characteristics

> - geometric mean = average change of growth
> - harmonic mean = averaging different rates producing equal effect

Chapterwise discussion:

1. classification, manifold, dichotomous, contingency tables, frequency distribution(discrete and continuous), range, class limits, correction factor, frequency density, bi-variate frequency, tabulation, stubs -> row headings, one-way, two-way, manifold table
   
2. graphical rep, pictograms, cartograms, one d, two d, three d, mulible bar diagrams, pie chart, circular diagram, histogram, frequency polygon, frequency curve, ogives-> less than, more than, quartiles, false base line, diagram, graph
    
3. central tendency, mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, arithmetic mean(simple and weighted), selecting an average, median, quartile, decile, percentile, measures of dispersion, scatter, range, quartile deviation, mean deviation, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, moments(raw and central), 
    beta and gamma -> skewed or symmetrical
    skewness, karl pearson, bowley coeffiecient, kurtosis
4. correlation(positive, negative, perfect and non), scatter diagram, Karl Pearson and Spearman coefficient of rank correlation, regression
5. Association of attributes, comparison, proportion method, yule's coefficient of association, coefficient of colligation and contingency
6. Interpolttion and extrapolation, 
8. Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Hypergeometric, Normal, SNV, CHisquare, Student T
