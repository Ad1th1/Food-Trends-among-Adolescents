This repository marks the beginning of my journey in the vast, dynamic and exciting field of research. 

The very first research project that I am embarking on, is one that is of vital importance to both me, and my peers. Through this project, I wish to explore and study health trends amongst adolescents. 

By collecting and cleaning vast amounts of data from the required age-group, I seek to find variations and correlations by comparing various parameters. I do hope that this research will give me an insight into how I can help my peers lead better, healthier and wholesome lives.

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Veeraj and Mrs. Nisha for guiding me along this journey. I am also incredibly grateful to Mitul, Amrutha and Jinit, my team-members for their respective contributions.
